# mqtt-kat

mqtt-kat is an attempt at an [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) broker based on the concepts of [http-kit](https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit). As http-kit this means low level java code to do the handling of the NIO and decoding and encoding of the MQTT packets. MQTT packets are en/decoded to Clojure maps and handled by Clojure code to do all the clever stuff a broker needs to do.

The idea is to see if a MQTT Broker could be as scalable as http-kit and handle as many concurrent connection as http-kit does.

## What does it do at the moment?

Well... with the latest push it can actually forward a `PUBLISH`ed message to multiple clients that have `SUBSCRIBE`d to a particular topic. I have tested this with three subscribers concurrently. At the moment there is no support for wildcards in subscriptions. While those message are accepted and acknowledged nothing is done with them.

## Are there any bugs?

Yes!

Loads. Too many to mention actually. But here are a few I know of:

* Two or more clients with the same client-id can connect simultaneously.
* When a message is published and there are no subscribers for that topic we get an NPE.
* Disconnecting clients in error cases is not fully implemented.
* Declining `CONNECT` packages is needed.
* `UNSUBSCRIBE` is not handled.
* `SUBACK` is hardcoded
* Nothing is done for pings, no time out and subsequent disconnect.
* Only QOS 0 is assumed at the moment, no code in place for other QOS's

## What about the name?

I first thought of calling it mqtt-kit... but then decide that mqtt-kat made more sense. Somehow.

## Will it ever be a proper MQTT broker supporting QOS > 0?

Probably not.

## Will it ever support MQTT version 5?

Probably not.

## Usage

I call `(start)` function in the repl and then use an MQTT client to send packets to it and wait for it to crash.

## Thank you

First of all an extra big thank you to [Feng Shen](http://shenfeng.me/) for making http-kit. I have borrowed heavily from his code. And also a big thank you to the [Eclipse Paho Project](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/). I have used their [code](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.java) as inspiration as well and yes I have copied the MQTT packet length code from them.
